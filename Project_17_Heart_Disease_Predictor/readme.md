# Heart Disease Prediction System
## Overview
This project is a web application that predicts the risk of heart disease based on various medical parameters using a machine learning model. The system is built with Flask for the backend, scikit-learn for the machine learning model, and HTML/CSS for the frontend interface.

## Features
Input Form: Collects 13 medical parameters related to heart health

Prediction Model: Uses a Logistic Regression model trained on heart disease data

Responsive Interface: Clean and user-friendly web interface

Real-time Prediction: Provides immediate risk assessment

## Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset containing the following features:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type (cp)

Resting blood pressure (trestbps)

Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting blood sugar (fbs)

Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)

Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)

Exercise induced angina (exang)

ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak)

Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)

Number of major vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)
